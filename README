This will be my environment for learning.

- I will first start with the basics of Python and then move on to more advanced topics.
- All the code is written in Visual Studio Code and executed on my local machine, in terminal.
- I use Copilot for writing code snippets.
- I try to push all the modifications to GitHub as soon as I make them.
- I will also try to write a blog post on the topics I learn, to solidify my understanding.
