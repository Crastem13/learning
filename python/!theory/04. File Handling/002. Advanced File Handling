    Advanced File Handling

Reading and Writing Binary Files:
Binary files are used to store data in a binary format. You can read and write binary 
files using 'rb' and 'wb' modes, respectively.

Example:

# Writing to a binary file
with open("example.bin", "wb") as file:
    file write(b"Binary data")

# Reading from a binary file
with open("example.bin", "rb") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

    Working with CSV Files
#---------------------------#
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are widely used to store tabular data. You can use 
the 'csv' module to read from and write to CSV files.

Example:

import csv

# Writing to a CSV File
with open("example.csv", "w", newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 30, "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 25, "Los Angeles"])


# Reading from a CSV File
with open("example.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
