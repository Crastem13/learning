Reading and Writing Binary Files:
Binary files are used to store data in a binary format. You can read and write binary 
files using 'rb' and 'wb' modes, respectively.

Example:

# Writing to a binary file
with open("example.bin", "wb") as file:
    file write(b"Binary data")

# Reading from a binary file
with open("example.bin", "rb") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
