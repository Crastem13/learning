    Conditional Statements

#---------------------------#
Definition:
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain code blocks based on the evaluation of a condition. In Python, the main conditional statements are if, elif, and else.

Example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

#---------------------------#
    Loops

#---------------------------#
Definition:
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary) or repeat a block of code multiple times.

#---------------------------#
For Loop: 
    Used to iterate over a sequence
Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#---------------------------#
While Loop:
    Repeats as long as a condition is true.
Example:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 

#---------------------------#
Break and Continue:
    Break: Exits the loop prematurely.
    Continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
Example:
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print

#---------------------------#
Small Example:

# Conditional Statements
x = 8
if x % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{x} is even")
else:
    print(f"{x} is odd")

# For Loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue  # Skip 3
    print(number)

# While Loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1
