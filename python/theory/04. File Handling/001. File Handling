    File Handling

#---------------------------#
Opening a file 
    To open a file in Python, you use the 'open()' function, which returns a file object.
You can specify the mode in which the file is opened:
    - 'r': Read mode (default) - Opens the file for reading.
    - 'w': Write mode - Opens the file for writing (creates a new file if it doesn't exist 
    or truncates an existing file).
    - 'a': Append mode - Opens the file for appending (creates a new file if it doesn't 
    exist).
    - 'b': Binary mode - Used for binary files (e.g., images).
    - '+': Update mode - Allows reading and writing.

Example:

file = open("example.txt", "r")

#---------------------------#
Reading a File
    You can read contents of a file using methods such as 'read()', 'readline()', and 
'readlines()'

Examples:

# Read the entire file
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Read one line at a time
file.seek(0)  # Move cursor to the beginning of the file
line = file.readline()
while line:
    print(line, end='')
    line = file.readline()

# Read all lines into a list
file.seek(0)
lines = file.readlines()
print(lines)

#---------------------------#
Writing to a File
    You can write to a file using the 'write()' method or the 'writelines()' method for 
writing multiple lines.

Example:

file = open("example.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
file.write("This is a new line.")
file.close()

#---------------------------#
Using the 'with' Statement
    The 'with' statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finished, 
even if an exception is raised.

Example:

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

#---------------------------#
Small Example:

# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Python is amazing!\n")
    file.write("Let's learn more.")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

This script writes some text to a file named example.txt and then reads the content from the 
file, printing it to the console.
