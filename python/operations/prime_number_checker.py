# Prime Number Checker

## Definition:
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other 
# than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number ( p ) is a number that cannot be 
# formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

## Objective: 
# Create a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.

## Requirements:
# 1. Create a function called is_prime that takes a single parameter n.
# 2. Check if n is a prime number.
# 3. Return True if n is prime, otherwise return False.
# 4. Write a few test cases to demonstrate the functionality of your prime number checker.
